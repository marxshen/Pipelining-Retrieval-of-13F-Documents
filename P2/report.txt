[Description of project 2]
Analysis of 13F documents in terms of RIAs and their associated securities.

Statistics for securties (
    sum of value per quarter,
    sum of shares per quarter,
    weighting of sum of value per quarter,
)

Statistics for RIAs (
    sum of number of securities per quarter,
    sum of value per quarter,
    sum of shares per quarter,
    change of sum of value per quarter,
    change of sum of shares per quarter
)

[Input]
Paris of CIKs and their corresponding quarters. For instance, (0000895421, 2020Q1).

List of CIKs:

[Pipeline structure]
For analysis:
1st stage: preparing the indexes (pairs of ciks and their corresponding quarters) to query.
2nd stage: analysis of 13F documents in terms of securities 
3rd stage: analysis of 13F documents in terms of RIAs

For frontend:
1st stage: retrieving statistics in terms of securities from 13F documents.
2nd stage: retrieving statistics in terms of RIAs from 13F documents.

[Write up]
The number of workers needs to be adjusted to an optimal value.
Otherwise, the scarcity of or the surplus of workers may be detrimental to the performance of the pipeline.

For instance, based on the simulation in the absence of the pipeline architecture,
if only one worker participates in the pipeline of P2/pipe.py, the execution time is around 7 minutes.
If more than 10 workers are involved in the pipeline of P2/pipe.py, the execution time ranges from 4 to 5 minutes.
Only 5 to 10 workers would be an optimal number of workers for implementing an efficient pipeline architecture.
The execution time of the pipeline consisting of 5 to 10 workers is around 3 minutes.

I assume that this situation may concern the competition between workers for resources either from CPU or from MYSQL.

Although I practice the pipeline architecture on app.py
to accelerate the execution time of retrieving data from the database and displaying data on the website, the outcome is futile.

I think that this futile attempt may concern the excess of opening and closing MYSQL connections due to enormous queries.
Hence, the performance of app.py still needs to be improved.

From the data displayed on the website, I found that
the portfolios of BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC and TWO SIGMA SECURITIES, LLC are more concentrated than other RIAs
since both of their top 9 securities almost occupy more than 50% of the value of RIAs in recent 2 years.

A pymysql.err.IntegrityError: (1048, "Column 'cik' cannot be null") occurs when P2/pipe.py is executed.
I think that this error is not a serious issue since I discovered that this error occurs 
when the program fails to insert a single record consisting of null columns into the database.
Also, the data is utterly analyzed and transferred to corresponding tables, the data integrity is preserved.

I assume that this error may concern pymysql internal implementation as regards MYSQL.

Finally, D3.js is a useful and powerful tool to deal with interactive information visualization
since D3.js offers a decent degree of flexibility over manipulating HTML and CSS elements when one designs various charts.

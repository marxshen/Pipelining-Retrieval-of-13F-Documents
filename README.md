# Pipelining Retrieval of 13F Documents

The program retrieves (crawls and fetches), parses, stores and analyzes 13F documents concerning RIAs and their associated securities. Then, the program applies D3.js to visualize the documents with line, pie and doughnut charts.

The program's design consists of 5 stages in the pipeline architecture featuring asynchronous approaches. Each phase of the pipeline is assigned 6-10 workers.
